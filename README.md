# ApexUtils

In this repository I'm storing ideas in development and Snippets for later use.

1. ApexContext *(will be removed / become a part of 'ProcessFlow')*

      * A prebuild DTO class with build-in 'commit'
      
1. DataContainer
1. GenericRecordBuilder
1. MockBase
1. Query Counter *(will be removed)*
1. SelectorFactory & Selector Base
1. [MapUtility](https://github.com/DavidWalther/ApexUtils/tree/master/force-app/main/MapUtility)

    * Let's 'user' define criteria and then handles the building.
    * Can map 'anything by everything'

1. [ProcessFlow](https://github.com/DavidWalther/ApexUtils/tree/master/force-app/main/ProcessFlow) *(might be renamed)*
    
    * Works with stateless logic and a DTO 
    * Figures out the order by it's self
